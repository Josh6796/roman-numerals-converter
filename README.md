# Convert Roman Numeral String to Integer in C#

I wrote a little string extension method which converts a roman numeral into an integer.

See [here](https://github.com/Josh6796/roman-numerals-converter/blob/main/app/RomanNumeralConverter.cs) for the converter class and [here](https://github.com/Josh6796/roman-numerals-converter/blob/main/app/Program.cs) for examples.
